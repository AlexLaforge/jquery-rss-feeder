# jquery-rss-feeder

The purpose of this code is to scroll Twitter in an RSS feeds using a 'fancy' CSS driven ticker vertically using jQuery. 

The main code was written in classic ASP because that si what we use on our current system. It can easy be converted to other laguages. The HTML is just an exmaple of what the RSS feed will look like after the ASP has inported and parced the RSS feed. I included it only because I helps when styling the CSS and working with the JQuery code. However, the ASP is actually able to create the HTML on the fly from any RSS feed.
